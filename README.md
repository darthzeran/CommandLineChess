Node JS Command Line Chessboard

I was "board" one weekend and coded it up.  It should support all chess rules, including castling, promotion, En Passant, and not being able to castle through check.

HOW DO I START?
- get node
- run code.

Taking turns, each player enters in the square they want a piece to move from, and then the square they want the piece to move to.

Add issues if you find a bug! 
Thanks.
